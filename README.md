# Accessibility_TransportPoverty
This repository contains the full R code developed as part of the Master's Thesis “Transport Poverty Indicators: A Framework for Measuring Access to Essential Services”

The objective is to provide a data-driven, replicable framework for analyzing transport poverty using GTFS (General Transit Feed Specification) and open mobility datasets. The methodology focuses on accessibility-based indicators, allowing for spatial and temporal analysis of public transport equity in urban areas.
Load your gtfs files, store them in your directory and change the address in the code.
